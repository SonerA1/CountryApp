# CountryApp

### CountryApp 
CountryApp is an application that gives general information about countries.
We have collected general information such as the capital of the countries, 
what language they speak, and the currency in a single application. 
We pull our data from the internet. 
Although it looks like a simple application in the image, what is used in it will show you the size of the application.
Many elements of Jetpack, the most popular technology of Android, are used in the application.
